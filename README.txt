LemanTh Root Website (Jekyll) â€” v2
==================================

Changes in this version:
- Fixed dropdown CSS scoping so the navbar dropdown cannot interfere with gallery elements.
- Reordered navbar: Gallery before Past editions.
- Added `assets/img/LemanTh.png` placeholder and placed it on the front page under the title.
- Converted the front page to Markdown (`index.md`) to simplify edits.

Deploy:
1) Unzip into the root of `leman-th.github.io` (replace existing files).
2) Commit & push.
3) Ensure GitHub Pages serves from the root of the default branch.
